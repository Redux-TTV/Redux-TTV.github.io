        I remember it like it was yesterday. I was 13, and Myspace&trade; had just started picking up steam. 
        It was quickly found out that most textboxes accepted HTML, and it was a race to the top to figure
        out who could make the best looking page (and hide the music player, forcing you to listen to our crappy emo music).
        It was there, in the dredges of the internet that I got my first glimpse at what it looked like to be a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fast-forward to my late-teens/early 20s. Most of my interest in development had fallen to the waist-side, and I only
        had an associates degree to show for it. I still didn't know what I wanted to do.

    <h5>Career</h5>

    <p>
        My technical career did not take off until my early 20s. Previously I'd worked in the service industry, and had a stint
        where I "fixed" people's computers at your local office supply store. Needless to say, none of this was especially satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was presented with the opportunity to switch focus and start as a hardware tester for Hewlett-Packard. It was mind-numbing,
        but it reminded me of what I loved about working with computers. I would find myself looking through the code that powered
        our tests. Mostly VB.NET with some proprietary firmware code baked in. I became very interested, and was later presented with another
        opportunity to be the one writing the code for the tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially, I was instructed to learn Python, with a deadline to learn of 30 days before being thrown into the deep end.
        I accepted, and did my best to run through as many tutorials as I possibly could. Needless to say, going from zero
        to actively working on internal code was very difficult. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I prevailed, and my work quickly shifted to writing both Python and the VB.NET code that ran our tests. Eventually, 
        my code was powering the entire test environment, including data collection(though that part was a team effort).
        Once this program had it's legs, I shifted to learning C# in order to facilitate a new data-collection application.
        I never got too deep, but I was able to get through the fundamentals of using an object-oriented language. Life events
        forced a move to Eugene, OR, where I continued to work remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a contractor, your employment is never guaranteed. Unfortunately, that was the case for me. I was let go from Hewlett-Packard during a round of layoffs.
        I found myself working for Willamette Valley Company doing some database and IT administration work. A bit of a far-cry from
        doing development, but I was grateful to learn more about back-end systems. After about a year, I yearned to get back into development,
        and it was not going to happen with this position.
    </p>
    <p>
        I moved back to Vancouver, WA, continuing to work remotely for Willamette Valley Company, training a replacement while looking for work.
        During the search, a lot of time was spent running through bootcamps and crash courses for web development. I knew almost instantly that
        developing on that platform was what I wanted to do, and began applying for almost any job that was looking for a junior-level developer.
        I found one with Consolidated Community Credit Union. I was able to quickly get into the weeds of using a LAMP stack, and learned more
        in my time here than I have anywhere else in my career, and I couldn't be happier.
