        It all started at 13. Myspace&trade; had just started picking up steam, and it was a race to the top to figure
        out who could make the best looking page, hide the music player, and force innocent bystanders to listen to our crappy emo music.
        It was there, in the dredges of the internet that I got my first glimpse at what it meant to teach myself web design.

    <h5>Career</h5>

    <p>
        As much as I revelled in web design early on, My technical career did not take off until my early 20s. Until that point, I'd worked 
        in the food service industry, not including a stint where I "fixed" people's computers at your local office supply store. 
        Needless to say, none of this was especially satisfying.

        I was presented with the opportunity to switch focus and start as a contracted hardware tester for Hewlett-Packard. It was mind-numbing,
        but it reminded me of what I loved about working with computers. I would find myself looking through the code that powered
        our tests. Mostly VB.NET, along with some proprietary firmware code baked in. As my interest showed, another opportunity 
        presented itself. An engineer offered me a position writing the code, on one condition:
    </p>
    <p>Learn Python in 30 days.</p>
    <p>
        Scared and excited, I put my best foot forward, and ran through every possible free tutorial I could find (probably every single 
        one on the internet at the time). After 30 days, it was time to show the fruits of my labor.
    </p>
    <p>It did not go well.</p>
    <p>
        As any developer can attest, trying to get off the ground in 30 days with no functional programming experience is not going to be easy.
        Luckily I had made enough headway into the fundamentals that I didn't drown when thrown into the deep end.
        Eventually, everything started to click. My work quickly shifted to writing both Python and maintaining the VB.NET code that ran our tests.
        Once the programs I was working on had their legs, I began learning C# to support a project another team was working on.

        Life events forced a move to Eugene, Oregon, where I continued to work remotely. As a contractor, your employment is never 
        guaranteed, and I was unfortunately let go during a round of layoffs. I began work with Willamette Valley Company 
        doing database, ERP, and IT administration work. A bit of a far-cry from programming, but I was grateful to learn more about 
        back-end systems and get some hands-on experience with a database. After about a year, I yearned to get back into development, 
        and it was not going to happen with this position.
    </p>

        I moved back to Vancouver, Washington, continuing to work remotely for Willamette Valley Company while looking for work.
        During the search, a lot of time was spent running through bootcamps and crash courses for web development. I knew almost instantly that
        developing on that platform was what I wanted to do, and began applying for almost any job that was looking for a junior-level web developer.
        Consolidated Community Credit Union contacted me, and I jumped right in.

        I currently work in a LAMP stack environment administering the company intranet and public-facing website. I work with PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript,
        Python, MYSQL, and a bit of VB.NET daily. Finally doing the development I've been craving ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
